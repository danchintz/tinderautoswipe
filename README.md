# tinderautoswipe
An auto swiper for the web version of tinder

# How to use
The code is all in index.js, just copy that, and create a bookmark with it. Then, when you are on the tinder.com page swiping away, click the bookmark and it should run.

The code is self explanatory, it selects and clicks the like button in a loop with a 100ms delay between clicks.

Big recommendation to use Tinder Pro or else you will run out of swipes pretty quickly.
